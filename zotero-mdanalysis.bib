	abstract = {Research software is a fundamental and vital part of research worldwide, yet there remain significant challenges to software productivity, quality, reproducibility, and sustainability. Improving the practice of scholarship is a common goal of the open science, open source software and FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) communities, but improving the sharing of research software has not yet been a strong focus of the latter. To improve the FAIRness of research software, the FAIR for Research Software (FAIR4RS) Working Group has sought to understand how to apply the FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship to research software, bringing together existing and new community efforts. Many of the FAIR Guiding Principles can be directly applied to research software by treating software and data as similar digital research objects. However, specific characteristics of software — such as its executability, composite nature, and continuous evolution and versioning — make it necessary to revise and extend the principles. This document presents the first version of the FAIR Principles for Research Software (FAIR4RS Principles). It is an outcome of the FAIR for Research Software Working Group (FAIR4RS WG). The FAIR for Research Software Working Group is jointly convened as an RDA Working Group, FORCE11 Working Group, and Research Software Alliance (ReSA) Task Force.},

	abstract = {Cholesterol is the most abundant molecule in the plasma membrane of mammals. Its distribution across the two membrane leaflets is critical for understanding how cells work. Cholesterol trans-bilayer motion (flip-flop) is a key process influencing its distribution in membranes. Despite extensive investigations, the rate of cholesterol flip-flop and its dependence on the lateral heterogeneity of membranes remain uncertain. In this work, we used atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to sample spontaneous cholesterol flip-flop events in a DPPC:DOPC:cholesterol mixture with heterogeneous lateral distribution of lipids. In addition to an overall flip-flop rate at the time scale of sub-milliseconds, we identified a significant impact of local environment on flip-flop rate. We discuss the atomistic details of the flip-flop events observed in our simulations.},

We performed molecular dynamics computer simulations of two systems, both composed of a number of water molecules together with a layer of either purely hydrophilic or purely hydrophobic molecules restrained in mobility so as to form walls. Simulations were done at constant temperature and at constant volume or constant pressure. We found that the hydrophilic wall induces strong ordering near its surface, but such order is present only up to about two molecular diameters away from it. On the other hand, the hydrophobic wall induces a slight ordering, but this ordering remains for several molecular diameters inside the bulk.},

The model integrates all-atom and coarse-grained potentials in a simple and systematic way and allows a fast sampling of the complex conformational energy surface typical of polymers whilst maintaining a realistic description of selected atomistic interactions. In particular, we show that it is possible to simultaneously reproduce the structure of highly directional non-bonded interactions such as hydrogen bonds and efficiently explore the large number of conformations accessible to the polymer chain. We apply the method to a melt of polyamide removing from the model only the degrees of freedom associated to the aliphatic segments and keeping at atomistic resolution the amide groups involved in the formation of the hydrogen bonds. The results show that the multiscale model produces structural properties that are comparable with the fully atomistic model despite being five times faster to simulate.},

The diffusion map is a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique with the capacity to systematically extract the essential dynamical modes of high-dimensional simulation trajectories, furnishing a kinetically meaningful low-dimensional framework with which to develop insight and understanding of the underlying dynamics and thermodynamics. We survey the potential of this approach in the ﬁeld of molecular simulation, consider its challenges, and discuss its underlying concepts and means of application.

Here, we show how the 2′-hydroxyl controls RNA conformational properties. Quantum mechanical calculations reveal that the orientation of the 2′-hydroxyl significantly alters the intrinsic flexibility of the phosphodiester backbone, favoring the A-form in duplex RNA when it is in the base orientation and facilitating sampling of a wide range of noncanonical, tertiary structures when it is in the O3′ orientation. Influencing the orientation of the 2′-hydroxyl are interactions with the environment, as evidenced by crystallographic survey data, indicating the 2′-hydroxyl to sample more of the O3′ orientation in noncanonical RNA structures. These results indicate that the 2′-hydroxyl acts as a “switch”, both limiting the conformation of RNA to the A-form at the secondary structure level and allowing RNA to sample a wide range of noncanonical tertiary conformations.},

	abstract = {Here, we present an update of the CHARMM27 all-atom additive force field for nucleic acids that improves the treatment of RNA molecules. The original CHARMM27 force field parameters exhibit enhanced Watson-Crick base pair opening which is not consistent with experiment, whereas analysis of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations show the 2′-hydroxyl moiety to almost exclusively sample the O3′ orientation. Quantum mechanical (QM) studies of RNA related model compounds indicate the energy minimum associated with the O3′ orientation to be too favorable, consistent with the MD results. Optimization of the dihedral parameters dictating the energy of the 2′-hydroxyl proton targeting the QM data yielded several parameter sets, which sample both the base and O3′ orientations of the 2′-hydroxyl to varying degrees. Selection of the final dihedral parameters was based on reproduction of hydration behavior as related to a survey of crystallographic data and better agreement with experimental NMR J-coupling values. Application of the model, designated CHARMM36, to a collection of canonical and noncanonical RNA molecules reveals overall improved agreement with a range of experimental observables as compared to CHARMM27. The results also indicate the sensitivity of the conformational heterogeneity of RNA to the orientation of the 2′-hydroxyl moiety and support a model whereby the 2′-hydroxyl can enhance the probability of conformational transitions in RNA. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provide a valuable tool for studying membrane models, complementing experimental approaches. It is now possible to simulate large membrane systems, such as simplified models of bacterial and viral envelope membranes. Consequently, there is a pressing need to develop tools to visualize and quantify the dynamics of these immense systems, which typically comprise millions of particles. To tackle this issue, we have developed visual and quantitative analyses of molecular positions and their velocity field using path line, vector field and streamline techniques. This allows us to highlight large, transient flow-like movements of lipids and to better understand crowding within the lipid bilayer. The current study focuses on visualization and analysis of lipid dynamics. However, the methods are flexible and can be readily applied to e.g. proteins and nanoparticles within large complex membranes. The protocols developed here are readily accessible both as a plugin for the molecular visualization program VMD and as a module for the MDAnalysis library.},

	abstract = {In molecular dynamics simulations under periodic boundary conditions, particle positions are typically wrapped into a reference box. For diffusion coefficient calculations using the Einstein relation, the particle positions need to be unwrapped. Here, we show that a widely used heuristic unwrapping scheme is not suitable for long simulations at constant pressure. Improper accounting for box-volume fluctuations creates, at long times, unphysical trajectories and, in turn, grossly exaggerated diffusion coefficients. We propose an alternative unwrapping scheme that resolves this issue. At each time step, we add the minimal displacement vector according to periodic boundary conditions for the instantaneous box geometry. Here and in another paper [J. T. Bullerjahn, S. von Bülow, and G. Hummer, J. Chem. Phys. 153, 024116 (2020)], we apply the new unwrapping scheme to extensive molecular dynamics and Brownian dynamics simulation data. We provide practitioners with a formula to assess if and by how much earlier results might have been affected by the widely used heuristic unwrapping scheme.},

Current computers are not fast enough to probe all available conformations, but fluctuations around one conformation can be sampled to a reasonable extent. The motions with the largest fluctuations can be filtered out of a simulation using covariance or principal component analysis. A problem with this analysis is that random diffusion can appear as correlated motion. An analysis is presented of how long a simulation should be to obtain relevant results for global motions. The analysis reveals that the cosine content of the principal components is a good indicator for bad sampling.},

	abstract = {Connexins (Cxs) are a family of vertebrate proteins constituents of gap junction channels (GJCs) that connect the cytoplasm of adjacent cells by the end-to-end docking of two Cx hemichannels. The intercellular transfer through GJCs occurs by passive diffusion allowing the exchange of water, ions, and small molecules. Despite the broad interest to understand, at the molecular level, the functional state of Cx-based channels, there are still many unanswered questions regarding structure-function relationships, perm-selectivity, and gating mechanisms. In particular, the ordering, structure, and dynamics of water inside Cx GJCs and hemichannels remains largely unexplored. In this work, we describe the identification and characterization of a believed novel water pocket—termed the IC pocket—located in-between the four transmembrane helices of each human Cx26 (hCx26) monomer at the intracellular (IC) side. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to characterize hCx26 internal water structure and dynamics, six IC pockets were identified per hemichannel. A detailed characterization of the dynamics and ordering of water including conformational variability of residues forming the IC pockets, together with multiple sequence alignments, allowed us to propose a functional role for this cavity. An in vitro assessment of tracer uptake suggests that the IC pocket residue Arg-143 plays an essential role on the modulation of the hCx26 hemichannel permeability.},

The toroidal boundary conditions are accounted for in a natural way if the integral equation is formulated (and solved) in Fourier space. Rigorous expressions for the polarization induced by a homogeneous field as well as for the equilibrium dipole moment fluctuations, both as a function of the dielectric constant, are then easily derived for general systems in two and three dimensions. The equations obtained for spherical cutoff geometry with reaction field are identical to those valid for an infinite periodic system (Ewald sum plus reaction field). When applied to the case of a highly polar Stockmayer system (μ*2=3·0, θ*=0·822, T*=1·15) the formulas lead to a consistent value of the dielectric constant that is independent of the precise value of the reaction field—if the number of particles is sufficiently large. In the thermodynamic limit the dielectric constant obtained with the reaction field method seems to be much higher than one would expect from the Ewald sum results published for the Stockmayer system at the same thermodynamic state.},

	shorttitle = {napari},
	url = {https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3555620},
	abstract = {napari 0.4.16 These are the preliminary release notes for 0.4.16 release candidates. The final release notes will be posted with the release on 2022-05-31. We're happy to announce the release of napari 0.4.16! napari is a fast, interactive, multi-dimensional image viewer for Python. It's designed for browsing, annotating, and analyzing large multi-dimensional images. It's built on top of Qt (for the GUI), vispy (for performant GPU-based rendering), and the scientific Python stack (numpy, scipy). For more information, examples, and documentation, please visit our website. File Opening Changes in 0.4.16 Prior to npe2, file opening with plugins worked through a cascade of function calls trying different readers until one worked, or all failed, in which case an error would be raised. Preferences for readers could be set by reordering hook implementations in the Call Order preference dialog. This behavior was slow, confusing, and often led to unexpected results. You can see more discussion on this in issue \#4000. npe2 supports readers declaring a list of accepted filename patterns, and PR \#3799 added a dialog for users to select a plugin to read their file (if more than one was available), and save a preference for that file extension. Before removing plugin call order, we want to make sure that file opening behavior across the GUI and command line is predictable, reproducible and explicit. After discussion in \#4102, \#4111 and this zulip thread, we decided that as a guiding principle, calling viewer.open should not infer a plugin choice for you, and any inference behavior should be opt in. This has led to the following API and GUI changes builtins is now the default value for the plugin argument in viewer.open. This means you should always explicitly pass a plugin to viewer.open, if you don't want to use builtins (and we encourage you to pass the argument anyway). To specify a plugin in a Python script: import napari viewer = napari.Viewer() viewer.open('my-path.tif') \# this will throw MultipleReaderError if napari\_tifffile is installed as both it and builtins could open the file viewer.open('my-path.tif', plugin='napari\_tifffile') \# this won't viewer.open will not inspect your file extension preferences, and will not choose among available plugins if you wish to opt into the "gui-like" behavior where your preferences are respected and we infer a plugin if just one is compatible with your file path, you must explicitly use plugin=None To opt into plugin inference behavior: import napari viewer = napari.Viewer() viewer.open('my-path.nd2', plugin=None) If multiple plugins could read your file, you will see a MultipleReaderError A preferred reader missing from current plugins will trigger a warning, but the preference will be otherwise ignored A preferred reader failing to read your file will result in an error e.g. if you saved napari\_tifffile as a preference for TIFFs but then tried to open a broken file To save a preference for a file pattern in Python, use: from napari.settings import get\_settings get\_settings().plugins.extension2reader['*.tif'] = 'napari\_tifffile' get\_settings().plugins.extension2reader['*.zarr'] = 'napari-ome-zarr' When opening a file through a GUI pathway (drag \& drop, File -{\textgreater} Open, Open Sample) with no preferences saved, you are provided with a dialog allowing you to choose among the various plugins that are compatible with your file This dialog also allows you to save a preference for files and folders with extensions This dialog also pops up if a preferred reader fails to open your file This dialog does not pop up if only one plugin can open your file Running napari path in the shell will also provide the reader dialog. You can still pass through a plugin choice, or layer keyword arguments To specify a plugin at the command line, use: napari my-path.tif --plugin napari\_tifffile Preference saving for file reading is now supported for filename patterns accepted by npe2 readers, rather than strictly file extensions Existing preferences for file extensions will be automatically updated e.g. .tif will become *.tif Reader preferences for filename patterns can be saved in the GUI via the preference dialog Reader preferences for folders are not yet supported in the GUI preference dialog - use the Python method above This will be addressed by the next release We have thought carefully about these choices, but there are still some open questions to address, and features to implement. Some of these are captured across the issues listed below, and we'd love to hear any feedback you have about the new behavior!

	abstract = {Connexins (Cxs) are a family of vertebrate proteins constituents of gap junction channels (GJCs) that connect the cytoplasm of adjacent cells by the end-to-end docking of two Cx hemichannels. The intercellular transfer through GJCs occurs by passive diffusion allowing the exchange of water, ions, and small molecules. Despite the broad interest to understand, at the molecular level, the functional state of Cx-based channels, there are still many unanswered questions regarding structure-function relationships, perm-selectivity, and gating mechanisms. In particular, the ordering, structure, and dynamics of water inside Cx GJCs and hemichannels remains largely unexplored. In this work, we describe the identification and characterization of a believed novel water pocket—termed the IC pocket—located in-between the four transmembrane helices of each human Cx26 (hCx26) monomer at the intracellular (IC) side. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to characterize hCx26 internal water structure and dynamics, six IC pockets were identified per hemichannel. A detailed characterization of the dynamics and ordering of water including conformational variability of residues forming the IC pockets, together with multiple sequence alignments, allowed us to propose a functional role for this cavity. An in vitro assessment of tracer uptake suggests that the IC pocket residue Arg-143 plays an essential role on the modulation of the hCx26 hemichannel permeability.},

	abstract = {There is increasing evidence that protein dynamics and conformational changes can play an important role in modulating biological function. As a result, experimental and computational methods are being developed, often synergistically, to study the dynamical heterogeneity of a protein or other macromolecules in solution. Thus, methods such as molecular dynamics simulations or ensemble refinement approaches have provided conformational ensembles that can be used to understand protein function and biophysics. These developments have in turn created a need for algorithms and software that can be used to compare structural ensembles in the same way as the root-mean-square-deviation is often used to compare static structures. Although a few such approaches have been proposed, these can be difficult to implement efficiently, hindering a broader applications and further developments. Here, we present an easily accessible software toolkit, called ENCORE, which can be used to compare conformational ensembles generated either from simulations alone or synergistically with experiments. ENCORE implements three previously described methods for ensemble comparison, that each can be used to quantify the similarity between conformational ensembles by estimating the overlap between the probability distributions that underlie them. We demonstrate the kinds of insights that can be obtained by providing examples of three typical use-cases: comparing ensembles generated with different molecular force fields, assessing convergence in molecular simulations, and calculating differences and similarities in structural ensembles refined with various sources of experimental data. We also demonstrate efficient computational scaling for typical analyses, and robustness against both the size and sampling of the ensembles. ENCORE is freely available and extendable, integrates with the established MDAnalysis software package, reads ensemble data in many common formats, and can work with large trajectory files.},

Overall, the lipid fingerprints of the four transporters are comprised of similar lipids when grouped by headgroup or tail saturation. The enrichment and depletion of specific lipids, including sites of cholesterol contacts, varies between transporters. The subtle differences in lipid fingerprints results in varying membrane biophysical properties near the transporter. Our results highlight that the lipid-fingerprint of SLC6 transporters in complex membranes is highly dependent on membrane composition. Our results further characterize how the presence and identity of membrane proteins affects the complex interplay of lipid-protein interactions, influencing the local lipid environment and membrane biophysical properties.},

	abstract = {The dissociation of ligands from proteins and other biomacromolecules occurs over a wide range of timescales. For most pharmaceutically relevant inhibitors, these timescales are far beyond those that are accessible by conventional molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Consequently, to explore ligand egress mechanisms and compute dissociation rates, it is necessary to enhance the sampling of ligand unbinding. Random Acceleration MD (RAMD) is a simple method to enhance ligand egress from a macromolecular binding site, which enables the exploration of ligand egress routes without prior knowledge of the reaction coordinates. Furthermore, the τRAMD procedure can be used to compute the relative residence times of ligands. When combined with a machine-learning analysis of protein–ligand interaction fingerprints (IFPs), molecular features that affect ligand unbinding kinetics can be identified. Here, we describe the implementation of RAMD in GROMACS 2020, which provides significantly improved computational performance, with scaling to large molecular systems. For the automated analysis of RAMD results, we developed MD-IFP, a set of tools for the generation of IFPs along unbinding trajectories and for their use in the exploration of ligand dynamics. We demonstrate that the analysis of ligand dissociation trajectories by mapping them onto the IFP space enables the characterization of ligand dissociation routes and metastable states. The combined implementation of RAMD and MD-IFP provides a computationally efficient and freely available workflow that can be applied to hundreds of compounds in a reasonable computational time and will facilitate the use of τRAMD in drug design.},

	abstract = {MDAnalysis is an object-oriented Python library to analyze trajectories from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in many popular formats. With the development of highly optimized MD software packages on high performance computing (HPC) resources, the size of simulation trajectories is growing up to many terabytes in size. However efficient usage of multicore architecture is a challenge for MDAnalysis, which does not yet provide a standard interface for parallel analysis. To address the challenge, we developed PMDA, a Python library that builds upon MDAnalysis to provide parallel analysis algorithms. PMDA parallelizes common analysis algorithms in MDAnalysis through a task-based approach with the Dask library. We implement a simple split-apply-combine scheme for parallel trajectory analysis. The trajectory is split into blocks, analysis is performed separately and in parallel on each block ({\textbackslash}textquotedbl\{\}apply{\textbackslash}textquotedbl\{\}), then results from each block are gathered and combined. PMDA allows one to perform parallel trajectory analysis with pre-defined analysis tasks. In addition, it provides a common interface that makes it easy to create user-defined parallel analysis modules. PMDA supports all schedulers in Dask, and one can run analysis in a distributed fashion on HPC machines, ad-hoc clusters, a single multi-core workstation or a laptop. We tested the performance of PMDA on single node and multiple nodes on a national supercomputer. The results show that parallelization improves the performance of trajectory analysis and, depending on the analysis task, can cut down time to solution from hours to minutes. Although still in alpha stage, it is already used on resources ranging from multi-core laptops to XSEDE supercomputers to speed up analysis of molecular dynamics trajectories. PMDA is available as open source under the GNU General Public License, version 2 and can be easily installed via the pip and conda package managers.},

	abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) computer simulations help elucidate details of the molecular processes in complex biological systems, from protein dynamics to drug discovery. One major issue is that these MD simulation files are now commonly terabytes in size, which means analyzing the data from these files becomes a painstakingly expensive task. In the age of national supercomputers, methods of parallel analysis are becoming a necessity for the efficient use of time and high performance computing (HPC) resources but for any approach to parallel analysis, simply reading the file from disk becomes the performance bottleneck that limits overall analysis speed. One promising way around this file I/O hurdle is to use a parallel message passing interface (MPI) implementation with the HDF5 (Hierarchical Data Format 5) file format to access a single file simultaneously with numerous processes on a parallel file system. Our previous feasibility study suggested that this combination can lead to favorable parallel scaling with hundreds of CPU cores, so we implemented a fast and user-friendly HDF5 reader (the H5MDReader class) that adheres to H5MD (HDF5 for Molecular Dynamics) specifications. We made H5MDReader (together with a H5MD output class H5MDWriter) available in the MDAnalysis library, a Python package that simplifies the process of reading and writing various popular MD file formats by providing a streamlined user-interface that is independent of any specific file format. We benchmarked H5MDReader's parallel file reading capabilities on three HPC clusters: ASU Agave, SDSC Comet, and PSC Bridges. The benchmark consisted of a simple split-apply-combine scheme of an I/O bound task that split a 90k frame (113 GiB) coordinate trajectory into chunks for processes, where each process performed the commonly used RMSD (root mean square distance after optimal structural superposition) calculation on their chunk of data, and then gathered the results back to the root process. For baseline performance, we found maximum I/O speedups at 2 full nodes, with Agave showing 20x, and a maximum computation speedup on Comet of 373x on 384 cores (all three HPCs scaled well in their computation task). We went on to test a series of optimizations attempting to speed up I/O performance, including adjusting file system stripe count, implementing a masked array feature that only loads relevant data for the computation task, front loading all I/O by loading the entire trajectory into memory, and manually adjusting the HDF5 dataset chunk shapes. We found the largest improvement in I/O performance by optimizing the chunk shape of the HDF5 datasets to match the iterative access pattern of our analysis benchmark. With respect to baseline serial performance, our best result was a 98x speedup at 112 cores on ASU Agave. In terms of absolute time saved, the analysis went from 4623 seconds in the baseline serial run to 47 seconds in the parallel, properly chunked run. Our results emphasize the fact that file I/O is not just dependent on the access pattern of the file, but more so the synergy between access pattern and the layout of the file on disk.},

MD simulations of biological molecules have become an important tool to elucidate the relationship between molecular structure and physiological function. Simulations are performed with highly optimized software packages on HPC resources but most codes generate output trajectories in their own formats so that the development of new trajectory analysis algorithms is confined to specific user communities and widespread adoption and further development is delayed. MDAnalysis addresses this problem by abstracting access to the raw simulation data and presenting a uniform object-oriented Python interface to the user. It thus enables users to rapidly write code that is portable and immediately usable in virtually all biomolecular simulation communities. The user interface and modular design work equally well in complex scripted work flows, as foundations for other packages, and for interactive and rapid prototyping work in IPython / Jupyter notebooks, especially together with molecular visualization provided by nglview and time series analysis with pandas. MDAnalysis is written in Python and Cython and uses NumPy arrays for easy interoperability with the wider scientific Python ecosystem. It is widely used and forms the foundation for more specialized biomolecular simulation tools. MDAnalysis is available under the GNU General Public License v2.},

Thus, H5MD inherits many benefits of HDF5, e.g., structured layout of multi-dimensional datasets, data compression, fast and parallel I/O, and portability across many programming languages and hardware platforms. H5MD files are self-contained, and foster the reproducibility of scientific data and the interchange of data between researchers using different simulation programs and analysis software. In addition, the H5MD specification can serve for other kinds of data (e.g. experimental data) and is extensible to supplemental data, or may be part of an enclosing file structure.},

US copyright law is a barrier to the sharing of scientific scholarship since it establishes exclusive rights for creators over their work, thereby limiting the ability of others to copy, use, build upon, or alter the research. This is precisely opposite to prevailing scientific norms, which provide both that results be replicated before accepted as knowledge, and that scientific understanding be built upon previous discoveries for which authorship recognition is given. In accordance with these norms and to encourage the release of all scientific scholarship, I propose the Reproducible Research Standard (RRS) both to ensure attribution and facilitate the sharing of scientific works.
